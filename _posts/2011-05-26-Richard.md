Three month since the last release of GNDMS, which means: Time for a new
one! So we give you GNDMS 0.3.4 "Richard". This release contains many
stability improvements especially in the GridFTP handling, logging and
task handling in general. 

If you got trouble with Shigeru you definitely want Richard.
