Just a short update about our REST development efforts:

We are now going to test the code for our first REST-based release of
GNDMS. It will contain a not feature complete reimplementation of the
GORFX service and the Slice-Service part of the DSpace service.

The branch for the rest development, is now `rest-devel` (who would've
guessed that). 

Apart from urgent bug-fixes, development of the GT4 based (i.e. the
`master`-branch) version has reached its end. Thus the rest-devel
branch will replace master as soon as it reaches RC state.
