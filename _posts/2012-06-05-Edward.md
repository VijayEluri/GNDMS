Realizing we solved three issues, we had to release version 0.6.2 of GNDMS. We hope it comes as a real bombshell.

We added two plugins we thought might come handy, namely InterSliceTransfer and ESGF-Staging.
Additionally, Transport Layer Security can now be used to secure communication between nodes.
