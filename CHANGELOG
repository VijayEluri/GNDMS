0.2.2 alpha: "Marcelino"

@Providers:
* [NEW] Support for calling external scripts with XML-formatted properties (ExternalProviderStageIn)
* [NEW] (Optional) cancel-scripts are now supported by ExternalProviderStageIn.  The cancel-script is called when staging has failed
* [CHANGED] ExternalProviderStaging now logs either StdOut (succesful script execution) or StdOut+StdErr (failed script execution)
* [CHANGED] Contract-type with support for absolute and relative (duration/offset) values for executionLikelyBefore and resultValidUntil
* [CHANGED] Enhanced error reporting via container.log and hopefully more verbose RemoteExceptions
* [CHANGED] Changed exit codes of estimation scripts to be more in line with UNIX conventions
    public static final int EXIT_CODE_UNFULFILLABLE = 127;
    public static final int EXIT_CODE_PERMISSION_DENIED = 126;
* [CHANGED] Shutdown behaviour; exit code > 127 willl cause a delay of 60s before marking a staging task as failed.  This became necessary
  to deal with globus shutdown behaviour which may cause spurious script exit codes and thus broke restarting old tasks upon restart
  of Globus...
* [FIX] Lots of many small bugs have been squished making this release much more stable
* [MINOR] Log software version number on startup
* [MINOR] Tempdir used during execution of estimation scripts can be set via the environment variable GNDMS_TMP


@DMS:
* [NEW] C3Catalog Configlet for the integration of G2 DMS and RIS (MDS)
* [NEW] SliceStageIn: Staging via central DMS site
* [NEW] InterSliceTransfer: File copy via central DMS site


@Developers:
* [NEW] Ant-file for compiling GNDMS from scratch (Experimental but works)
* [NEW] Configlets for additional (static) configuration of GNDMS installations
* [NEW] Persistent subtasks without an associated resource (e.g. for calling transfer inside staging)
* [CHANGED] Failure handling of GORFX tasks, onFailed() is now called even if the associated TaskResource has timed out
* [CHANGED] Cleaned up setup-scripts
* [CHANGED] Quite a bit of refactoring, esp. Contract and InstanceDirectory
* [CHANGED] Started switching to automatic dependency injection via guice (See SystemDirectory)
