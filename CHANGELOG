0.2.2 alpha: "Marcelino"

@Providers:
* [NEW] Support for calling external scripts with XML-formatted properties (ExternalProviderStageIn)
* [NEW] (Optional) cancel-scripts are now supported by ExternalProviderStageIn.  The cancel-script is called when staging has failed

    public static final int EXIT_CODE_UNFULFILLABLE = 127;
    public static final int EXIT_CODE_PERMISSION_DENIED = 126;
* [CHANGED] Shutdown behaviour; exit code > 127 willl cause a delay of 60s before marking a staging task as failed.  This became necessary
  to deal with globus shutdown behaviour which may cause spurious script exit codes and thus broke restarting old tasks upon restart
  of Globus...
* [FIX] Lots of many small bugs have been squished making this release much more stable
* [MINOR] Log software version number on startup
* [MINOR] Tempdir used during execution of estimation scripts can be set via the environment variable GNDMS_TMP

* [CHANGED] Cleaned up setup-scripts
* [CHANGED] Quite a bit of refactoring, esp. Contract and InstanceDirectory
* [CHANGED] Started switching to automatic dependency injection via guice (See SystemDirectory)
* [CHANGED] Set OpenJPA transaction behaviour to Multithreaded, RetainState, RestoreState=all and fixed looping bugs in TaskAction
