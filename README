This branch contains ad-hoc implementation of the GORFX rest
specification.  It can be used by developers of GNDMS client services
to test the integration and the basic setup.

The interface is stable with the exception that new methods might be
added and some types may be refined. 

The branch has three imported folders:

gndmc-rest     Contains the code of client side.
gorfx          Holds the restified GORFX service code.
gndms-commons  Contains code shared by the client and service, e.g.
               types used for exchange and the interfaces describing
               the service.

Please consult the HTML documentation in 
    http://gndms.zib.de/developer-guide/rest/
which contains additional infos along with the installation guide
