This branch contains implementation of the REST-based GNDMS version.

Appart from urgend bugfixes the GT4 based (i.e. the *master*-branch)
version will not be subejct to further development. Thus the
rest-devel branch will replace master as soon as it reaches RC state.


The REST-interface is stable with the exception that new methods might be
added and some types may be refined. 

A list of new and important folder:

gndms          Contains the servlet setup and the master application
               context.
gorfx          Holds the restified GORFX service code.
dspace         Holds the restified DSpace service code.
gndms-commons  Contains code shared by the client and service, e.g.
               types used for exchange and the interfaces describing
               the service.
gndmc-rest     Contains the code of client side.


Please have a look at INSTALL for a short setup-guide.
