This branch contains implementation of the REST-based GNDMS version.

The WS, resp. GT4, based version can still be found on the
ws-gndms-devel branch.  Apart from urgent bug-fixes the GT4 based
version will not be subject to further development. 


The REST-interface is stable with the exception that new methods might be
added and some types may be refined. 

A list of new and important folder:

gndms          Contains the servlet setup and the master application
               context.
gorfx          Holds the restified GORFX service code.
dspace         Holds the restified DSpace service code.
gndms-commons  Contains code shared by the client and service, e.g.
               types used for exchange and the interfaces describing
               the service.
gndmc-rest     Contains the code of client side.

The other layers are equel to the ones from the WS version.

Please have a look at INSTALL for the setup-guide.

Feel free to consult the HTML documentation in 

    http://gndms.zib.de/developer-guide/rest/

which contains additional infos.


The documentation on 

    http://gndms.zib.de

still refers to the WS version and will be updated in the coming
weeks.
