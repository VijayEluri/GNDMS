Until 'devel' goes 'master' additional documentation is gathered here:

Setup the slice-chown:
----------------------
The configlet setup is located in 
    scripts/features/enable-slice-chown.sh
It introduces the path of the chown-script to GNDMS. 
The script is located in $GNDMS_SOURCE/dev-bin/chownSlice.sh and
should be installed to $GNDMS_SHARED with owner root and perm 700.
Additionall the 'globus' user must be allowed to call this script as
root. For this copy the following entry to your 'sudoers' file
globus ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: <$GNDMS_SHARED>/chownSlice.sh
Note: The <$GNDMS_SHARED> must be expanded to the contents of
$GNDMS_SHARED MANUALLY.
