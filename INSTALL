To build/install:


- (For Deployment: Set up globus and load it into your environment)
- Compile infra to extra/lib/gndms-infra.jar
- Execute sync.sh in this directory.  This will create all necessary symlinks in the services' lib directories.  Without doing this, you're going to miss required jar files.
- Build the services in services/* using ant createDeploymentGar and deploy to your liking.
