Until 'rest-devel' goes 'master' additional documentation is gathered here:

Setup rest example:
-------------------

Compile and package everything.

    buildr package
        -> $GNDMS_SOURCE/lib/gndms/gndms-gndms-0.6.0-pre.war

Download and install Jetty version 6-8 are fine. Export  $JETTY_HOME
as the base dir of your Jetty installation.


*WARNING: THE NEXT STEP WILL ERASE THE CONTENTS OF
`$JETTY_HOME/webapps/root`*

Execute

    buildr install

which installs the exploded war into `$JETTY_HOME/webapps/root`.

Setup the service config:

   Copy $GNDMS_SOURCE/gorfx/src/META-INF/gorfx.properties 
   to   $JETTY_HOME/resources/gorfx.properties

Set the environment variable GORFX_URL to

    http://<yourhost>:<and-port>/gndms/<grid-name>

Echo this to your grofx.properties
echo gorfxBaseURL=$GORFX_URL > $JETTY_HOME/resources/gorfx.properties

Create grid.properties in the same directory ($JETTY_HOME/resources/)
by executing

    echo gridName=C3Grid >> $JETTY_HOME/resources/grid.properties
    echo gridPath=<Path-to-gridconfig>  >> $JETTY_HOME/resources/grid.properties

Replace <Path-to-gridconfig> with the path where you like to store the
settings of your grid, note this directory must be writable for the
user running GNDMS.

Start Jetty

Running the client
NOTE this requires the GORFX_URL environment variable.
Additionally an env-var GNDMS_DN must be set, with your grid dn.

To compile and run the client simply enter:
buildr gndms:gndmc-rest:run
