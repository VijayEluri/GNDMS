Until 'rest-devel' goes 'master' additional documentation is gathered here:


Setup GNDMS-0.6.0:
==================

Compile and package everything.
-------------------------------

    buildr package
        -> $GNDMS_SOURCE/lib/gndms/gndms-gndms-0.6.0-pre.war

Download and install Jetty version 6-8 are fine. Export  $JETTY_HOME
as the base dir of your Jetty installation.

Execute

    buildr install

which installs the gndms war into `$JETTY_HOME/webapps/gndms.war` as
well as 

    grid.properties to $JETTY_HOME/gndms

and

    gndms.xml to $JETTY_HOME/contexts


Setup the service config:
-------------------------
Open 

    $JETTY_HOME/gndms/grid.properties 

in an editor of your choice and check if the `dspaceBaseURL` and
`gorfxBaseURL` are correct. Additionally check if `gridPath` points to
the desired folder.



Set the environment variable GORFX_URL to

    http://<yourhost>:<and-port>/gndms/<grid-name>

Echo this to your grofx.properties
echo gorfxBaseURL=$GORFX_URL > $JETTY_HOME/resources/gorfx.properties

Create grid.properties in the same directory ($JETTY_HOME/resources/)
by executing

    echo gridName=C3Grid >> $JETTY_HOME/resources/grid.properties
    echo gridPath=<Path-to-gridconfig>  >> $JETTY_HOME/resources/grid.properties

Replace <Path-to-gridconfig> with the path where you like to store the
settings of your grid, note this directory must be writable for the
user running GNDMS.

Start Jetty

Running the client
NOTE this requires the GORFX_URL environment variable.
Additionally an env-var GNDMS_DN must be set, with your grid dn.

To compile and run the client simply enter:
buildr gndms:gndmc-rest:run
