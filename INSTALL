Please consult the HTML documentation in doc/web/_site/index.html which contains the installation guide

Until 'devel' goes 'master' additional documentation is gathered here:

Setup the slice-chown:
----------------------
The configlet setup is located in 
    scripts/features/enable-slice-chown.sh
It introduces the path of the chown-script to GNDMS. 
The script is located in $GNDMS_SOURCE/dev-bin/chownSlice.sh and
should be installed to $GNDMS_SHARED with owner root and perm 700.
Additionall the 'globus' user must be allowed to call this script as
root. For this copy the following entry to your 'sudoers' file
globus ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: <$GNDMS_SHARED>/chownSlice.sh
Note: The <$GNDMS_SHARED> must be expanded to the contents of
$GNDMS_SHARED MANUALLY.


Setup rest example:
-------------------

buildr gndms:gorfx-rest:package
    -> $GNDMS_SOURCE/lib/gorfx/gndms-gorfx-rest-0.3.0.war

Download and install Jetty to $JETTY_HOME
Copy 
    $GNDMS_SOURCE/lib/gorfx/gndms-gorfx-rest-0.3.0.war
to 
    $JETTY_HOME/webapps/gndms.war

Setup the service config:
   Copy $GNDMS_SOURCE/gorfx/src/META-INF/gorfx.properties 
   to   $JETTY_HOME/resources/gorfx.properties
Set the environment variable GORFX_URL to
    http://<yourhost>:<and-port>/gndms/<grid-name>
Echo this to your grofx.properties
echo gorfxBaseURL=$GORFX_URL > $JETTY_HOME/resources/gorfx.properties

Start Jetty

Running the client
NOTE this requires the GORFX_URL environment variable.
Additionally an env-var GNDMS_DN must be set, with your grid dn.

To compile and run the client simply enter:
buildr gndms:gndmc-rest:run
