OVERVIEW
========

GNDMS consists of a set of globus wsrf services for distributed grid data
management based on staging and co-scheduling. It abstracts from data sources
via a data integration layer and provides logical names, data transfers,
garbage collection, workspace management and a centralized catalog for logical
file sets.

Originally, GNDMS has been written exclusively for the data management needs
of c3grid (www.c3grid.de). However, the implementation is flexible enough for
reuse by other projects.



  
=============                
PREREQUISITES
=============

Whether you want to build the project yourself or just want to deploy the
service you need to satisfy the following prerequisites (an example shell
configuration (bash) can be found in etc/example.profile):

- Install a current version of J2SEE Version 5 and its accompanying JDK   
  
  For compiling the services, please make sure that JAVA_HOME points to this 
  version and that this is also the version that is in your PATH.  Naturally,
  this should be the same version than the one you use to run globus and ant.

- Install ant
- Set $ANT_HOME and have it in your environment
- Add $ANT_HOME/bin to your path

- Get Globus 4.0.7
- Setup working host and user certificates (You can build without; but then 
  again where would this  get you?)
- Set $GLOBUS_LOCATION and have it in your environment
- Load $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh and 
  $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-devel-env.sh into your environment

- Install apache-derby-bin-10.4.X
- Set $DERBY_HOME and have it in your environment
- Add $DERBY_HOME/bin to your PATH
             
- Install groovy >=1.6
- Set $GROOVY_HOME and have it in your environment
- For convenience, have it in your environment, you might also want to 
  add $GROOVY_HOME/bin to your PATH

- Install openssl                                 
- Install curl
- Both should be available in your $PATH
                                                                                 
- Set C3GRID_SOURCE to the source directory and have it in your environment
- Set C3GRID_SHARED to $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/c3grid_shared and have it in 
  your environment
- Set GNDMS_MONI_CONFIG to $C3GRID_SHARED/monitor.properties and have it in 
  your environment

- Add the directory called "bin" below the directory of this INSTALL file to 
  your PATH (This means you should *not* delete the downloaded sources after 
  installation)

  Alternatively, copy all scripts from bin to some directory accessible from
  your PATH.

  In any case, whenever you update GNDMS, please make sure that you also
  apropriately point your PATH to the new version's bin-scripts.


==================
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================
                                                                                   
If you dont want to build but instead just want to deploy, please skip to the
section titled "DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTION".

We don't have a proper global build script yet. Therefore you have to do lots
of things by hand, meaning this guide is not for the faint of heart. Before
you start please make sure you have succesfully installed all prerequisites.

The following description has a slight slant on IntelliJ but you should be
able to repeat it with any other java tool chain.


-------------
COMPILE STUBS
-------------

for i in services/* ; do ( cd $i && ant compileStubs ) ; done

If you ever want to delete all stubs, simply remove services/*/build/*


------------------
SETUP DEPENDENCIES
------------------
                                                                                  
When describing the dependencies of a compilation unit, I assume the following 
"project libraries"

- openjpa: extra/tools-lib/geronimo* serp* openjpa*
- gt4-current: everything in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib *but* none of the GNDMS 
  jars and also none of the other dependecy jars!
- db-derby: extra/tools-lib/derby*.jar
- apache-commons: extra/tools-lib/commons*.jar
- jetty: extra/tools-lib/jetty*.jar
- junit-45: extra/tools-lib/junit*.jar
- servlet-api: extra/tools-lib/servlet-api*.jar
- cos: extra/tools-lib/cos-*.jar
- GROOVY: extra/tools-lib/groovy*.jar
  If you use IntelliJ, use the global library GROOVY instead.
- SOURCES: The sources of the compilation unit

- "servicename"-stubs: service/"ServiceName"/build/stubs-"ServiceName"/classes
                                          
- annotations: extra/tools/lib/annotations.jar
  Nearly everything has a dependency to this one.
                     

---------------------------
DETAILED BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------

- The most tricky piece goes first:

  1) Compile the shared-model 
     Sources: model/src (resp. model/test-src)
     Output:  model/gndms-shared-model/production (resp. test)
     Dependencies: annotations, SOURCE, commons, openjpa, gt4, GROOVY
     
     Make sure META-INF gets copied 
     from model/src to model/gndms-shared-model/production!
   
  2) Execute:

     ln -sf "$GROOVY_HOME"/embeddable/groovy-all*jar \
            "extra/tools-lib/gndms-groovy.jar"
             
     This will be done later again when you run sync.sh but is needed now to 
     complete the next substep.

  3) Run the openjpa enhancer

     In model/, run ant -f build-openjpa.xml enhance
     

    This enhances the jpa classes and creates extra/lib/gndms-model.jar 

  (In IntelliJ: add build-openjpa.xml to the Ant-Build (right side) and
  configure the target enhance to be run post compilation)

  If you ever get weird errors during compilation or ant enhance, delete
  production/* and rebuild the whole project)

- Compile the infra 
  Sources: infra/src
  Output: extra/lib/gndms-infra.jar
  Dependencies: annotations, junit-45, gt4-current, SOURCES, 
                servlet-api, cos, openjpa, jetty,
                db-derby,  shared-model, GROOVY
  Re-export: openjpa, groovy                

  (In IntelliJ: Use Build/Build Jars.. to build the jar on Make Project)

- Execute sync.sh in the projects' top level directory. This will create all
  necessary symlinks in the services' lib directories. Without doing this,
  you're going to miss required jar files.

- Build the services in services/* using ant createDeploymentGar

  (Now you can deploy the gar files by executing "globus-deploy-gar <file>" as
  globus user. You might want to read the upcoming section on configuration
  and deployment first before doing so.)

- Additionally, for IDE based development, you may wish to set up projects per
  service. These should depend on

  annotations, servicename-stubs, shared-model, infra, SOURCES, all non-
  symlinks in service/ServiceName/lib,
  
  compile to out/production (resp. out/test), and exclude the services' out, 
  build, and lib directories from the project sources to reduce the size of 
  the project index.

  This should be enought to compile and develop with your IDE; for deployment
  you still need to execute "ant createDeploymentGar" and "globus-deploy-gar"


THINGS TO DO WHEN YOUR BUILD FAILS
----------------------------------

1) Do you need to regen the stubs? Delete service/*build/ and go from scratch
2) Stale symlinks
3) Reexecute sync.sh                           
4) If you cant deploy (i.e. globus-start-container balks with one of those
  40+-lines stacktraces) it's likely that you either miss some jars or that
  introduce created an invalid jndi-config.xml which can happen but is easy
  enough to fix: Just make sure there are neither duplicate service nor
  resourceHome entries in any of the jndi-config.xml files.
5) Do not use the character ':' in your directory path (it will mess up your
   classpath if you use IntelliJ)
6) This has been written for UNIX systems; on windows your mileage may vary.
   Example: You will definitely have to manually edit all service.properties
   files to use windows-style file separators.

Other common reasons for a failed container starts are invalid credentials
(hostkey/hostcert.pem) or outdated CRLs. In the latter case, the script
contained in contrib/fetch-crl may help you. Execute "fetch-crl -o
<grid-cert-dir>" with apropriate permissions (Depends on wget).



==========
DEPLOYMENT
==========
             

--------------------
CONTAINER DEPLOYMENT
--------------------

This is a general description. Further down are additional configuration
instructions for each possible role of a GNDMS site (data provider, publishing
storage site, main GNDMS site.

First, please make sure you have fullfilled all prerequisites as described in
the section titled "PRERQUISITES".

In order to deploy, simply execute as globus user

globus-deply-gar <garfile>

If you want to setup a data provider site, you need to deploy DSpace and
GORFX. If you want to setup a pure storage/publishing site, you need to deploy
DSpace only. If you want to setup your own GNDMS, you need to deploy WHORFX,
GORFX, and DSpace.

Next, please restart your container.

IMPORTANT: After your container has started, please execute

"fixPermissions.sh <globus-group> <globus-user>".

This step is very important! If you skip it, you may suffer from potential
security breaches.

Next, we need to enable the monitoring/configuration shell.

----------------------------------
MONITORING AND CONFIGURATION SHELL
----------------------------------

If you set up your environment as described in "PREREQUISITES" you may now use
the GNDMS monitoring and configuration shell. GNDMS is a little servlet that
allows the execution of groovy script code inside the running globus container
in order to initialize and configure the database or peek inside the running
system.

On most sites it is only accessed once to initialize the database during
installation.

GNDMS is disabled by default and protected by a randomly generated default
password. If enabled, it opens a socket on localhost for incoming connections.
Please consider that connections are *unencrypted* before configuring it to be
accessible from the network. Again, be aware that you can truely execute
arbitrary groovy code with globus user permissions through this channel and
therefore be cautious whenever using it. You might also want to enable it only
when needed.

To enable, edit $GNDMS_MONI_CONFIG and set monitor.enabled to "true". Then
either restart the container or wait "monitor.configRefreshCycle" ms (defaults
to 30 seconds). After this period the container will load your new
configuration and start the monitoring servlet.

To test your monitor connection execute

"moni init" to create a new session (Default session timeout is ca. 20 mins).
"moni open repl foo" to create a new monitor named "foo" that accepts multiple
commands ("repl" here is the run mode of the monitor. See below for a list of
possible values).

Next, please open a second shell and execute:

"moni send foo $C3GRID_SOURCE/scrips/hello.groovy"

If you see "Hello, World!" followed by "null" in the first shell you have
succesfully enbaled the monitoring console.

To close the connection named "foo", execute "moni close foo". To destroy your
session and close all named connections, execute "moni destroy". To force the
monitor to reread the confuration, execute "moni refresh". To force a restart
even if the configuration has not been altered, execute "moni restart".

Now, please continue with the subsection titled "CONFIGURATION".

             
WHEN THINGS DONT WORK
---------------------

1) If you dont get a connection, read your container log to make sure that the
   servlet has been started.
2) Make sure you have set up your environment as described in "PRERQUISITES".
3) If you execute moni and nothing happens you might have forgotten an
   argument. Currently, moni is just a bunch of helper bash scripts that call
   curl and lack proper argument checking. If you do not provide moni send with
   apropriate arguments, it may wait while attempting to read from stdin.
   

GNDMSH RUN MODES
----------------

SCRIPT (DEFAULT): Accept one send command, do not print result object.
REPL: Accept many send commands, always print result objects.
BATCH: Accept many send commands, but do not print result objects.
EVAL_SCRIPT: Accept one send command, print result object.

Specifying the mode in "moni open <mode> <name" is case-insensitive.

    
CONFIGURATION NOTES
-------------------

monitor.minConnections should always be >= 2


REMARKS FOR SCRIPT DEVELOPERS
-----------------------------

Inside your own groovy classes, you should always print to "out" or "err"
which contain the current monitor's output stream. Plain println only works
correctly in the script or its top-level functions.

"out" and "err" properties are added automatically to "Object.metaClass" when
instantiating a monitor. To enable them, "ExpandoMetaClass.enableGlobally()"
is called first.

Additional properties like resource homes and singleton resource instances are
made available using the same mechanism. A reference to an entity manager
guard is bound to "emg" (See EntityManagerGuard.java, basically this class
encapsulates JPA transaction processing inside GNDMS).
